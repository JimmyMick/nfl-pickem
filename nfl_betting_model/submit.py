"""Write pick sheets back to the GitHub repo from the cloud app.

Streamlit Community Cloud has an ephemeral filesystem, so the in-app pick form
can't just write ``predictions/picks/*.csv`` locally — the change would vanish on
reboot and never reach the Tuesday grade cron. Instead the form commits the
sheet back to GitHub via the Contents API; the committed CSV is exactly what the
existing grader / leaderboard already read, so nothing downstream changes.

Two layers, kept separate so the merge logic is testable without a network:

* :func:`merge_player_picks` — pure: takes the current sheet text (or ``None``)
  and one player's picks, returns the new CSV text. Preserves every other
  player's rows.
* :class:`GitHubStore` — thin Contents-API client (get/put a file). Needs a
  fine-grained token with **Contents: read/write** on just this repo.
